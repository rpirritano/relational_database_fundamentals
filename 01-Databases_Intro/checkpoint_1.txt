1.  Given this table of values, which data types and meanings are the same? Which are different?

values

| number | value | | ------ | ------ | | 1 | Chen | | 2 | Jones | | 3 | 42 | | 4 | Viola Davis |

***
    All the number meanings are the same data types - such as 1, 2, 3, 4 -> integer
    For the values: 1-Chen, 2-Jones, and 4-Viola are the same -> string
                    3-42 is the only differing value -> integer

2.  Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

***
    A database might be used when dealing with massage amounts of data which needs indexing and efficient
    storage. A database will allow for accessing the data quickly and easily, as well as preventing duplication
    of existing information by centralizing all the information.

    A text file might be used when you are simply grabbing all the data and dumping it to the screen, since it might
    even be faster than using a database for this purpose.  On benefit is that text files never crash, a database
    can.  Also, if there is not massive amounts of data, text files may be preferred since they can be read and
    edited with any tool you prefer and at any stage of the software development or production.

3.  Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

***
    One difference is that SQL is considered declarative rather than a procedural language.  For a procedural
    language you would write lines of code that perform one operation after another until the program completes.
    The programmer will specify what will be done and how to do it.  With SQL, you will tell it what to do without
    specifying exactly how to accomplish the task.  The DBMS, not the programmer will decide the best way to
    perform the job.

4.  In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

***
    A database is an organized collection of data.  It is a collection of schemas, tables, queries, and
    other objects.  The tables are made up of rows and columns that hold the data.  Each row is uniquely
    identified by a primary key, usually a single column, such as employeeID, for example.  The purpose
    of the primary key is to uniquely identify each row in the database and no two rows can have the same
    primary key.  This allows you to select any row by just knowing the primary key.  The columns will hold
    specific types of data, such as integers or strings.  A column will usually be defined by its name and
    data type.  So, the primary key of a row can be used to access any data of the columns quickly and
    efficiently.

5.  Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

***
    A database table is basically a table with rows and columns. Different tables contain information
    about different types of things.
    Each row in a database table represents one instance of the type of object described in the table.
    The columns in a table are the collections of data that we will keep track of about the type of object.
    The values can be considered the data elements and these values for each column will be of the same
    data type.

6.  List 3 data types that can be used in a table.

***
    Integers(INT), Character(CHAR), boolean

7.  Given the Payments table below, answer the following questions:

What is the result, if we select all the dates and amounts?

***
    | 5/1/2016  | 1500.00 |
    | 5/10/2016 | 37.00   |
    | 5/15/2016 | 124.93  |
    | 5/23/2016 | 54.72   |

What is the result, if we select all amounts greater than 500?

***
    | 1500.00 |

What is the result, be if we select all purchases made at Mega Foods?

***
    | Groceries|

8.  Given the users table below, write the following SQL queries and their results:

Select the email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.

***

  SELECT email, signup
  FROM users
  WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data';

Select the user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.

***

  SELECT userid
  FROM users
  WHERE email = 'aleesai.alorithm.edu';

Select all the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

***

  SELECT *
  FROM users
  WHERE userid = 4;
